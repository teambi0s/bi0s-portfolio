- Title: Taking the lead

    At bi0s it is a responsibility of every senior to mentor their juniors. This helps to inculcate teamspirit and 
    leadership skills among the students. The mentors assign responsibilities to their juniors and impose deadlines.
    In the journey so far, we have achieved the current heights only because of the excellent supervised mentoring by
    our seniors and alumni. It also helps building strong relationships within the teammates and improve the overall 
    efficiency of the team overtime.
