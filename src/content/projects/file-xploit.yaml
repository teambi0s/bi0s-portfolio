tagline: "This python module is used for generating payloads to exploit the FILE structure in C. Extremely useful in CTF challenges."
description:
    This library emulates the C File Structure and can generate automatic payloads for arbitrary read and write provided that there is a bug that allows us to overwrite a File Structure. It currently supports amd64 and i386 architectures.
